# stock-dashboard-dash

·	Built and deployed an interactive stock visualization web dashboard that fetches, processes and displays stock price and financial data with chart.

·	The dashboard app is useful for long-term investors who seek due diligence in stocks based on fundamentals (income statement, balance-sheet, etc.). 

·	The dashboard app is also useful for short-term investors who seek to find appropriate entry/exit  points based on correlation between stock price and sensitive indicators such as RSI, KDJ, W%R, etc.

·	Tools: Python, Pandas, Dash and HTML/CSS.
